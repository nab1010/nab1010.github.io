# Basics of OOP

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of wrapping pieces of data, and behavior related to that data, into special bundles call `objects`. which are contructed from a set of "blueprints", defined by programmer, called `classes`.

## Objects, classes

## Class hierarchies

# Pillars of OOP

## Abstraction

## Encapsulation

An **interface** - a public part of an object, open to interactions with other objects.

*Encapsulation* is the ability of an object to hide  parts of its state and behaviors from other objects, exposing only a limited interface to the rest of the program.

`private`- accessible only from within of the methods of its own class.

`protected` - makes a member of a class available to subclasses as well.


## Inheritance

## Polymorphism
